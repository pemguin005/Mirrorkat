# Description 

# Simple GUI running rsync, md5sum, YAD and bash commands
# on the backend for the purpose of streamlining the syncing 
# and making  archival copies of digital camera media files
# from SD cards, flash drives, external drives, etc.
#
# This program was built to streamline the process that
# photographers and videographers run into when they fill
# up SD cards on a photoshoot or video set, and they need
# a quick way to copy all their content to a drive quickly,
# drop all nested folders, and put all files in single spot,
# confirm that the data hasn't changed at all since leaving
# the card, and then rename all the files per the project
# name, date, and number sequence. 
#
# I'm hardly a programmer and so it's mostly simple bash
# commands piped into YAD for some easier usability. 
# There are definitely better ways to do this, but I'm 
# working only with what abilities the Linux+ gave me. ;P
